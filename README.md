## Abstract
3D LiDAR scene completion from point clouds is a fundamental component of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high‑fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi‑step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting real‐time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt—a lightweight, non‐diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise‑to‑Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi‑step iterative sampling of diffusion‑based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance‑dependent spatial distribution—densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance‑aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, **LiNeXt achieves a 199.8× speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7\%, and uses only 6.1\% of the parameters compared with LiDiff**. These results demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of LiNeXt for real-time scene completion.
